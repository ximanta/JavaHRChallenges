/**
 * A string is said to be a child of a another string if it can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters
 * from the other string. Given two strings of equal length, what's the longest string that can be constructed
 * such that it is a child of both?
 *
 * For example, ABCD and ABDC have two children with maximum length 3, ABC and ABD. They can be formed by
 * eliminating either the D or C from both strings. Note that we will not consider ABCD as a common child
 * because we can't rearrange characters and ABCD <> ABDC.
 *
 * Function Description
 *
 * Complete the commonChild function in the editor below. It should return the longest string which is a common
 * child of the input strings.
 *
 * commonChild has the following parameter(s):
 * - s1, s2: two equal length strings
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * There is one line with two space-separated strings, s1 and s2.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * 1 <= |s1|,|s2| <= 5000
 * All characters are upper case in the range ascii[A-Z].
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Print the length of the longest string s, such that s is a child of both s1 and s2.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * KENNY
 * MERRY
 *
 * Sample Output
 *
 * 2
 *
 * Explanation
 *
 * The longest string that can be formed by deleting zero or more characters from KENNY and MERRY is EY,
 * whose length is 2.
 *
 * Sample Input 1
 *
 * XY
 * UV
 *
 * Sample Output 1
 *
 * 0
 *
 * Explanation 1
 *
 * AA and BB have no characters in common and hence the output is 0.
 *
 * Sample Input 2
 *
 * SHINCHAN
 * NOHARAAA
 *
 * Sample Output 2
 *
 * 3
 *
 * Explanation 2
 *
 * The longest string that can be formed between SHINCHAN and NOHARAAA while maintaining the order is NHA.
 *
 * Sample Input 3
 *
 * ABCDEF
 * FBDAMN
 *
 * Sample Output 3
 *
 * 2
 *
 * Explanation 3
 *
 * BD is the longest child of the given strings.
