/**
 * Alice is taking a cryptography class and finding anagrams to be very useful. We consider two strings
 * to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string.
 * In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency For example,
 * bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.
 *
 * Alice decides on an encryption scheme involving two large strings where encryption is dependent on the
 * minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. Can you help her find
 * this number?
 *
 * Given two strings, a and b, that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of
 * character deletions required to make a and b anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the
 * strings.
 *
 * For example, if a=cde and b=dcf, we can delete e from string a and f from string b so that both remaining
 * strings are cd and dc which are anagrams.
 *
 * Function Description
 *
 * Complete the makeAnagram function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the minimum
 * total characters that must be deleted to make the strings anagrams.
 *
 * makeAnagram has the following parameter(s):
 *
 * - a: a string
 * - b: a string
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line contains a single string, a.
 * The second line contains a single string, b.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * - 1<=|a|,|b|<=10^4
 * - The strings a and b consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters ascii[a-z].
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Print a single integer denoting the number of characters you must delete to make the two strings anagrams
 * of each other.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * cde
 * abc
 *
 * Sample Output
 * 4
 *
 * Explanation
 *
 * We delete the following characters from our two strings to turn them into anagrams of each other:
 *
 * 1) Remove d and e from cde to get c.
 * 2) Remove a and b from abc to get c.
 *
 * We must delete 4 characters to make both strings anagrams, so we print 4 on a new line.
