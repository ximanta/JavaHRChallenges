     * Consider a staircase of size n=4:
     *     #
     *    ##
     *   ###
     *  ####
     *
     * Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn
     * using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.
     *
     * Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
     *
     * Function Description
     *
     * Complete the staircase function in the editor below. It should print a staircase
     * as described above.
     *
     * staircase has the following parameter(s):
     *
     * - n: an integer
     *
     * Input Format
     *
     * A single integer, n, denoting the size of the staircase.
     *
     * Constraints
     *
     * 0<n<=100.
     *
     * Output Format
     *
     * Print a staircase of size n using # symbols and spaces.
     * Note: The last line must have 0 spaces in it.
     *
     * Sample Input
     * 6
     *
     * Sample Output
     *
     *      #
     *     ##
     *    ###
     *   ####
     *  #####
     * ######
     *
     * Explanation
     *
     * The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of n=6.
